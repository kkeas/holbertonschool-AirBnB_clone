# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

Welcome to part 1 of many projects that make up the beginning
of a clone AirBnB.
This project is hosted by Holberton School.
```
Here we will do a small breakdown on how to open our console 
and how to use interactive mode as well as non-interactive.

<h2>Description</h2>

The AirBnB clone project's goal is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
You won’t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.
Beginning with these fundamental steps:

<h2>The console</h2>

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.

The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine

<h2>Interactive Mode</h2>

In the interactive mode, the console will display (hbnb) prompting the user to type in and execute a command. After the command is run, the prompt (hbnb) will appear again in a new line waiting for a new command to be entered. As long as the user doesn't quit the shell (by typing quit and pressing enter), this will go indefinitely.

<h2>Non-interactive Mode</h2>
In the non-interactive mode, the console is run with a command pipped into into its execution - this way the command is run as soon as the shell starts. In this mode no prompt (hbnb) appears, and no further input is expected from the user.
